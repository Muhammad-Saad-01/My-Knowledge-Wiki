In this book you'll find, in a wiki format, all the notes I made on a variety of topics.

The main goal is to store all the knowledge gathered throughout my life in a way that everyone can benefit from reading it or referencing in an easy and quick way.

I will be updating the content quite often as I use it myself daily both to keep an account of things I know as well as things I want to know and everything in between.

### Wiki structure

Each directory is a topic that can include other subtopics under it related to the parent topic. 

If this is your first time visiting this wiki, you can just start reading from the top entry down and see what sparks your interest.

### Content Structure <a id="content-structure"></a>

Each topic will have a title, some description of it, usually my own thoughts and knowledge on it as well as referencing some resources or links I have liked or used that helped me either understand the topic or gain an appreciation of it.

The structure of each of the posts will often look roughly like this:

1. Title
2. Description - My thoughts on the topic.
3. Subtopics - Various subtopics related to the main topic.
4. Notes - My own personal notes on the matter as well as things I found interesting on the internet regarding the topic. I often give a link of where I got things from.
5. Links - Links related to the topic.
