# Wiki Structure

Below you will find all the notes I made. I continuously update them and I use them myself for my own reference. I try to write things and structure them so everyone can benefit from reading them or even reference what I know easily and quickly.

Each folder is a topic that can include other topics under it related to the parent topic.

If this is your first time visiting this wiki, you can just start reading from the top entry down and see what sparks your interest.

I will be updating this wiki quite often as I use it myself daily both to keep an account of things I know as well as things I want to know and everything in-between.

If you find some mistake, especially if something that I say is plain wrong, please fork [this repository](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge) and make a PR with correct changes. Or [open an issue](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge/issues/new) saying what you think is wrong.
