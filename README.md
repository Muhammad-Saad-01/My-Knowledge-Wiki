# Introduction

للغة العربية انظر في الاسفل 👇🏻

This is my personal wiki where I share Everything I Know about this world in form of an [online GitBook](https://wiki.muhammad-saad.me) hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Muhammad-Saad-01/My-Knowledge-Wiki).and it's heavily inspired by [Omar Bahareth](https://github.com/obahareth) and [Nikita Voloboev](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge).

If this is your first visit, welcome! , you may be overwhelmed by the amount of content and don't know where to start reading. A good entry point is [meta](meta.md), where I describe this wiki, its structure, and goals in more detail.

As well as how to use them to develop [new transformative tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/).
